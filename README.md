This project is a bare-bones c++ game engine using SDL2 and OpenGL. It aims to be an open source asset that allows for game development with minimal abstraction. 

As of June 6, 2024 we have created dedicated timing, shading, object, and display classes. You can enable or disable vsync (press v), progress the gamestate (press space), resize the window or change background color (press any key while gamestate is in PLAY). You can also create randomly colored "Things" by pressing return. These can be moved around (arrows or wasd), scaled (+ or -) and rotated (q and e). Adjust the shape by pressing 3-9 on your number pad. Press z or esc to quit.

Smart pointers are so cool :D

Please contact me with any feedback or advice, especially regarding platform comptability. I have much to learn, and there's much, much more to come. Thanks.
