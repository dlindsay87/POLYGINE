This project is a bare-bones c++ game engine using SDL2 and OpenGL. It aims to be an open source asset that allows for game development with minimal abstraction. 

As of May 3, 2024 we have a time loop that can enable or disable vsync (press v), a gamestate that progresses and "pauses" (press space, or z to quit), and a window that changes color with any key press.

Please contact me with any feedback or advice, especially regarding platform comptability. I have much to learn, and there's much, much more to come. Thanks.
